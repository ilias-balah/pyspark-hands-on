# ðŸŽ¬ Section 1 - First PySpark Program

In this section, we use the [**MovieLens dataset**](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sundog-soft.com/es/ml-100k.zip) to run our first PySpark program and verify that the environment is set up correctly.

This dataset, extracted to the directory `data/ml-100k`, contains 100,000 ratings from 1,000 users on 1,700 movies.
